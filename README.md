Hi Folks!👋

So here is my first api creation using nodejs 🤓

Must be curious what this api actually does right ??!!!??

Basically this api takes image url as query parameter and forms a beautiful story. You can add as many urls you want in the api get call with each image url separeted with a comma. 😁✌

To check how it works:
1. Clone the repo
2. **npm start**(typically starts with port no : 3000). You can modidy to start in different port if you wish to from server.js file.
3. Hit following url in given format from your browser to check what it does :👇
    
    **http://localhost:3000/api/getImagesForStory?imageUrl='[YOUR 1ST URL]','[YOUR 2ND URL]'**
    
Clone and let the magic begin 💥💥💥💥💥
